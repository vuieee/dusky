I asked Claude Code to evaluate your script. Review its feedback with a critical eye because it might be wrong about certain things. Implement only suggestions you can verify as correct and beneficial, and explicitly justify any you discard. Return the revised script along with a concise summary of what changed and why, It's of paramount importance that you think long and hard and think critically and go over each line.
