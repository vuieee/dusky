The RDP method to disable display driver
## 🔄 Phase 3: The "Headless" Switch


Pre requistis, 
If you have a custom iso for whom remote desktop is ripped out, this rdp method wont work. go back and use the other method, (my custom win 10 iso has it ripped out , for win11 i somereason didnt rip it out. so win11 works. )
### Remote Desktop (RDP) Configuration
### 1. you must know your ip address for windows, 

check taskmanager, 
*OR*
Identify IP Address using Open PowerShell and run:

```
ipconfig
```
Note the IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.122.29`).

### 2. you must have a password set for the user, and know both your user name and password for windows. (you can also do it without it if you have access t group policy , )

> [!NOTE]
> **Option B: Allow Blank Passwords (The "I hate passwords" way)**
> - Press `Win + R`, type `secpol.msc`, and hit Enter.
> - Go to **Local Policies** -> **Security Options**.
> - Find: **"Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only"**.
> - Double-click it and set it to **Disabled**.

### 3. You must have remote desktop enabled in settings.
In Windows, go to **Settings > System > Remote Desktop**.
### 4. you must have your network set to private instead of public. 

### 5. You Must have set option 2 for this to work. [[Network Bridging for LAN access]] (virtio + Option 2 is the best ) 

This is the most critical step. We must disable the Emulated GPU ("Microsoft Basic Display" or "Red Hat QXL") to force Windows to use the Passthrough NVIDIA GPU.

> [!warning] Don't do this inside Virt-Manager!
> 
> If you disable the display adapter while looking at it through Virt-Manager, your screen will freeze, and you will lose mouse control. We must use RDP first.

### 1. Connect via RDP (The Rescue Line)

1. Get your VM's IP address (check your router or `ipconfig` inside the VM if you can see it). or from network section of the Task manager
    
2. Run this command from your Arch terminal:
    
### Replace 192.168.122.29 with YOUR VM IP
### Replace 'dusk' with YOUR Windows Username
```bash
xfreerdp3 /v:192.168.122.29 /u:dusk /cert:ignore /dynamic-resolution
```

>[!tip] A new window will open with your vm's screen. 
### 2. Disable the Basic Adapter

**Inside the RDP Session:**

1. Open **Device Manager**.
    
2. Expand **Display Adapters**.
    
3. Right-click **Microsoft Basic Display Adapter** (or Red Hat QXL).
    
4. Select **Disable Device**.
