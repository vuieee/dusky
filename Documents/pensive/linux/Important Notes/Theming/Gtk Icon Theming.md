you can pick one of the downlaoded/installed icon themes from nwg-look or with a command

eg 
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'Fluent-teal-dark'
```

to find out what the currently set icon theme is called 

```bash
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme
```
