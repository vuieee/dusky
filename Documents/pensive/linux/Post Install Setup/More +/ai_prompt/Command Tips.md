As an expert technical writer, please revise my manual for setup for this on linux arch,  make sure to make it clear, concise, and aesthetically pleasing.

    Add proper Markdown formatting (headings, lists, tables) and make it look Aesthetically pleasing and beautiful and intuitive this is for obsidian the second brain app.

    Include syntax‐highlighted code blocks for all commands and config snippets.

    Insert callouts (tips, warnings, notes) where appropriate.

    Improve overall clarity and flow, ensuring it works both as a step‐by‐step guide and a troubleshooting reference.

    Use succinct, precise phrasing and an appealing visual style throughout.

 I want to go at it slowly and methodically. 
make sure the language is clear and easy to understand. 

I want you to make sure to fill in the missing pieces where required it is Incredibly critical that you get this right so I want you to research extensively and think long and hard before responding

These commands might have missing pieces that are not listed. I want you to make sure that you restructure this in a way to allow for easy understanding and facilitate learning and also as a reference point for when you eventually forget something. I want you to make sure that you include every possible command in here and easily categorize them under different categories so as to allow for seamless learning and something that facilitates remembering of these commands. These are commands that I have written down in my personal notes because I am new to Arch Linux and I am trying to learn it inside and out and so as to also allow and aid my journey to becoming a system administrator. So with that in mind make sure each and everything is very neatly organized and very easily referenceable. Make sure that it looks visually appealing and I cannot emphasize enough how much the accuracy of this matters because I'm going to be working on a whole host of computers ranging from 700 to 1,000 computers so I have to have a very strong foundation of how Arch Linux works. I'm only going to be working on Arch Linux computers by the way. Make sure you research extensively and cross-verify, double-check your responses before responding. If there is an error in your response there will be immense consequences.

I want you to make sure that every last piece of information in this note is preserved. It is incredibly important that you do not omit or leave out any bit of information. This note has been created after an immense amount of research and a lot of time and dedication has been poured into creating these notes. And all the commands and all the instructions listed here should be preserved. You can add more things on top of them to make it more clear but you cannot omit or skip any command short of duplicates. If there is a duplicate you are free to delete the duplicate entry but that is the only exception. No other exception will be granted. This is the most important thing to pay mind to and I cannot emphasize or re-emphasize this enough. So make sure to not omit or leave out any existing piece of information from these notes. And I also want you to make sure that you employ good obsidian practices to link other notes so as to form connections. If there are or is an existing note with the same topic that goes in a lot more detail make sure to link to that.
