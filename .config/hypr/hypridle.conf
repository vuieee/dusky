# 5. SUSPEND SYSTEM
# ==============================================================================
# Action: Suspend the PC.

# NOTE: Hypridle listeners operate in parallel, not in a sequence. 
# Preventing an early stage (like "Dim Screen") does NOT automatically prevent 
# later stages (like "Screen Off" or "Suspend").
#
# If you want a condition (e.g., Audio Playing) to stop an action, you must 
# explicitly add that check to *that specific listener*.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# 1. To keep the screen BRIGHT while listening to music:
#    Add the audio check to the 'brightness' listener.
#
# 2. To keep the screen ON (but allow dimming) while listening to music:
#    Add the audio check to the 'dpms' (screen off) listener.
#
# 3. To prevent SUSPEND while listening to music:
#    Add the audio check to the 'suspend' listener (as shown below).
