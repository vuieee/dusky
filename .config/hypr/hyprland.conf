# HYPRLAND MAIN CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------------------------------------
# User: [dusky]
# System: UWSM Managed
# -----------------------------------------------------

# 1. MONITORS
# Must be first. Everything (workspaces, scaling, bar positioning) 
# depends on the physical layout being established.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/monitors.conf

# 2. PROGRAMS & ENVIRONMENT
# (Note: Most ENV vars are handled by `~/.config/uwsm/env` files)
# If you have Hyprland-specific vars that UWSM shouldn't see, put them here.
# This is also a good place to define $terminal, $fileManager, etc.
# I am assuming 'permissions.conf' contains Polkit agents or specific envs.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/permissions.conf

# 3. PLUGINS
# Plugins must be loaded before "Appearance" or "Keybinds" if those files 
# reference plugin-specific variables or dispatchers.
# source = ~/.config/hypr/source/plugins.conf

# 4. INPUT DEVICES
# Keyboard layouts, mouse sensitivity, and touchpad gestures.
# Loaded early so keybinds can map correctly to devices if needed.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/input.conf


# 5. APPEARANCE
# General settings, decorations (rounding, blur), animations, and colors.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/appearance.conf

# 6. WINDOW RULES & WORKSPACES
# Defines how windows behave (floating, tiling, opacity) before they are opened.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/window_rules.conf

# 7. KEYBINDINGS
# Binds actions to keys. Loaded after everything else so all dispatchers
# (plugin or standard) and rules are available.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/keybinds.conf

# 8. AUTOSTART
# Since you use UWSM, ensure this file uses `exec-once = uwsm-app -- ...`
# We load this LATE so that when apps launch, the monitors, inputs, 
# and window rules are already fully applied.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/autostart.conf

# 9. Environment Variables.
source = ~/.config/hypr/source/environment_variables.conf


# -----------------------------------------------------
# LOCAL OVERRIDES (GIT IGNORED)
# -----------------------------------------------------
# This file is for machine-specific settings (e.g., a specific monitor 
# setup for work vs home) or testing changes without committing them.
# It is loaded LAST to overwrite any setting above.
